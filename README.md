## Acknowledgments

I get the idea of using `max-inline-size` CSS properly from one of Kevin Powell's video ([HTML & CSS for Absolute Beginner: preventing layouts from getting to wide](https://youtu.be/Qqa2MJMxjw4?si=w0TjMLGoa_a7WVe5)) so thank you for your lesson
and I learned how to style `<ul>` and `<ol>` CSS elements using the `::marker` pseudo element selector from wed.dev lessons ([Selector](https://web.dev/learn/css/selectors?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fcss%23article-https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fcss%2Fselectors)) and thank you for that.
